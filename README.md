
# FILMFLEX
The goal of this project was to create a Front End React with the following Requirements:

Minimum Project Requirements:
There should be at least 4-5 functional components
There should be at least 3 or more pages (separate routes)
The Application must make use of React Router (npm install react-router-dom)
Uses at least one external API 
Prop passing of some sort
Has README.md file at the root of repository that clearly documents the purpose of the project, the target end user, and includes a link to the deployed version of the project
Must have a repository and make regular commits (at least 10 total)
Must be deployed (a good option is NetlifyLinks to an external site.)

I chose to use a MOVIE database API from "https://www.themoviedb.org/"
to make a website where a user can choose a film to watch from a list 
set by categories. The user can scroll to see whats available ion each catergory but if they
want to use the favorites option, they have to sign up with a username and password,
then are automatically logged in to add and delete faves at will.
